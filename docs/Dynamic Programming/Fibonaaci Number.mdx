### Problem Statement

The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,

```
    F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
    F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
```
Given n, calculate F(n).

** Example 1: **
```
    Input: n = 2
    Output: 1
    Explaination: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
```

** Example 2: **
```
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 2
    Explanation: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.
```

** Example 3: **
```
    Input: n = 4
    Output: 3
    Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

** Constraints: **
- `0 <= n <= 30`

### Approach: Recursion
- In this approach, I will use simple recursion to calculate the Fibonacci number.
- The base cases are when n is 0 or 1, where I will return n
- For other values of n, I will recursively call the function for (n-1) and (n-2) and return their sum as the Fibonacci number for n.

```java
class Solution {
    public int fib(int n) {
        if(n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return n;
        }
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis: Recursion
- Time Complexity: O(2^n), as each call to fib(n) results in two more calls to fib(n-1) and fib(n-2), leading to an exponential number of calls.
- Space Complexity: O(n), due to the maximum depth of the recursion stack being n.


### Approach: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)

- In this approach, I will use dynamic programming to calculate the Fibonacci number iteratively
- I will create an array to store the Fibonacci numbers up to n
- I will initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers, F(0) and F(1)
- Then, I will use a loop to fill in the array from F(2) to F(n) using the relation F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2).

    public int fib(int n){
        int result[] = new int[n + 2];
        result[0] = 0;
        result[1] = 1;
        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            result[i] = result[i - 1] + result[i - 2];
        }
        return result[n];
    }
}

### Complexity Analysis: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up)
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the input number, as we compute each Fibonacci
number from 2 to n once.
- Space Complexity: O(n), due to the array used to store Fibonacci numbers up to n.
