### Problem Statement

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

** Example 1: **

![addtwonum2example1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/sumii-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,8,0,7]
```

** Example 2: **

```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [8,0,7]
```

** Example 3: **

```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

** Constraints: **

* The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
* It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 9
* It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.

### Approach: Using Stack

- Use two stacks insert each node of the link list into their respective stacks.
- Pop the top element from both the stacks and add them.
- If the sum is greater than 9, then carry the 1 to the next addition.
- Create a new node with the sum % 10 and insert it into the result linked list.
- Repeat the above steps until both the stacks are empty.
- If there is a carry left, then insert a new node with the carry value into the result linked list.
- Return the result linked list.

        while(l1!=null){

            l1 = l1.next;

            l2 = l2.next;
        }
        ListNode list = new ListNode();
        int sum = 0;
        while(!stack1.empty() || !stack2.empty()){
            if(stack1.empty()) sum+= stack1.pop();
            if(stack2.empty()) sum+= stack2.pop();
            list.val = sum%10;
            ListNode head = new ListNode();
            head.val = sum / 10;
            head.next = list;
            list = head;
            sum /= 10;
        }
        return list.val == 0 ? list.next : list;
    }
}

### Complexity Analysis

* Time Complexity: `O(max(m,n))` where `m` and `n` are the number of nodes in the two linked lists.
* Space Complexity: `O(max(m,n))` where `m` and `n` are the number of nodes in the two linked lists.
