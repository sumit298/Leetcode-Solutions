### Problem Statement

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.


** Example 1: **

![addTwoNumbers](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg)

```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

** Example 2: **

```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

** Example 3: **

```
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
``` 

** Constraints: **

* `The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].`
* `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
* `It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.`

### Approach 1: Taking third linked list

* Create a new linked list to store the sum of the two linked lists.
* Traverse both the linked lists simultaneously.
* Add the values of the two nodes and store the sum in the new linked list.
* carry can be find by carry = sum/10.
* If the sum is greater than 9, then carry is 1 and the sum is stored as sum % 10.
* If the sum is less than 9, then carry is 0 and the sum is stored as it is.
* If one of the linked list is exhausted, then the remaining nodes of the other linked list are added to the new linked list.
* If the carry is 1, then a new node with value 1 is added to the new linked list.

### Complexity Analysis

* Time Complexity: O(max(m,n)) where m and n are the number of nodes in the two linked lists.
* Space Complexity: O(max(m,n)) where m and n are the number of nodes in the two linked lists.
