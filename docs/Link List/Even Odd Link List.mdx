### Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.
The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

- Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
- You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.

** Example 1: **

![oddeven example1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
```

** Example 2: **

![oddEven example2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven2-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```

** Constraints: **

- `The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [0, 104].`
- `-106 <= Node.val <= 106`

### Approach 1: 

- Create two linked lists, one for odd and one for even, call it Evenhead and oddHead;
- oddHead starts with head and evenHead starts with head.next;
- create a hold variable to hold the next node;
- Traverse the linked list till evenHead and its next not become null
- Now add the evenHead to the oddHead and oddHead to the evenHead;
- Now at last add OddHead.next to hold;
- return head;
