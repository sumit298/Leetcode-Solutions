## Problem Statement

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

### Problem link

[https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

** Example 1: **

![example1 ll](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

** Example 2: **

![example2 ll](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

** Constraints **

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100]. 
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`

### Approach: fast and slow pointers

- The problem can be solved by using the fast and slow pointers technique.
- The slow pointer moves one step at a time while the fast pointer moves two steps at a time.
- When the fast pointer reaches the end of the linked list, the slow pointer must be in the middle.

```java showLineNumbers
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head){
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;

        while(fast!=null && fast.next!=null){
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }

        return slow;
    }
}
```

** Complexity Analysis **

- Time complexity: `O(N)` where `N` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- Space complexity: `O(1)`, the space used by `slow` and `fast` pointers.


### Approach 2

```java showLineNumbers
class Solution {
    public static Node middleofLL2(Node head){
        Node midPrev = null;
        while(head!=null && head.next!=null){
            midPrev = midPrev == null ? head : midPrev.next;
            head = head.next.next;
        }
        Node mid = midPrev.next;
        midPrev.next = null;
        return mid;
    }
}
