## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

** Example 1: **
```
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0]
```

** Example 2: **
```
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
```

** Example 3: **
```
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
```

** Constraints: **
- 1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5
- 30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

### Approach: Using Stack
- We can use a stack to keep track of the indices of the days with unresolved warmer temperatures.
- We will iterate through the temperatures array from the end to the beginning.
- For each temperature, we will pop elements from the stack until we find a temperature that is warmer than the current temperature or the stack becomes empty.
- If the stack is not empty after popping, the difference between the current index and the index at the top of the stack will give the number of days to wait for a warmer temperature.
- Finally, we will push the current index onto the stack for future comparisons.

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures){
        int result = new int[temperatures.length];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for(int i=temperatures.length-1; i>=0; i--){
            while(!stack.isEmpty() && temperatures[stack.peek()] <= temperatures[i]){
                stack.pop()
            }
            if(!stack.isEmpty()){
                result[i] = stack.peek() - i;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

```

** Complexity Analysis **
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the temperatures array.
- Space Complexity: `O(n)` in the worst case for the stack.
